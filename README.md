# Using this folder

1. `Fork` the repository into your own Github, and `git clone` your version onto your Desktop.
2. You'll need to `cd` into the folder on your desktop, and type `npm i` in the Terminal, to install Bootstrap.
3. Open `index.html` in Sublime and Chrome.

Your challenge is to use the [Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/) to replicate the picture `big-ben-bootstrap.jpg`. Have fun!
